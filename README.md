SandboxMod
==========
1.7.10 minecraft mod that adds a bigger more challenging dungeon to the game that has loot. Currently just playing around and learning how things work. 

ChestGenHooks will not alter the loot content for the dungeons and increasing the size of the dungeon through the config file will cause more lag as it is generated (generated randomly depending on the chunk and seed). I am thinking of adding some methodolgoy of allowing other items to be placed in the lootChestBlock but not at the moment. 

Future plans/to do
============
work on it during weekends maybe 
- tidy up dungeon generation
- sort out items for the mod (currently got some random items from learning how to do stuff)
- work on some structure based generating structures maybe
